REMOTE SENSING WEDABAYWATCH!

...is the title of my project. I have a Python pipeline that successfully takes raw satellite images (landsat 8/9), clips them to my study area, stacks all the relevant bands (I defined these, B1-B7, B10, QA_pixel) and generates composites/indexes, e.g. NDVI, SAVI, etc. (also provided by me). 

Analysis work is done using jupyter notebooks, with python files handling the chunky functions.

The overall goal is to look at the study area - Weda Bay mining site - over time since before its inception, now. Currently we have data from 2016 - 2025 with 35 timestamps regularly spaced. 

Initial analysis:

found that NDVI declined around the mine site, but jungle further away was unaffected. Did this by having several different ROIs defined (created in ENVI classic)

Note the ROI names here: 

roi_colours = {
            'close_forest_1': '#7FBF00',
            'close_forest_2': '#99CC00',
            'greater_mine_site': '#A04020',
            'ocean_near_mine_site': '#1f77b4',
            'river_outlet': '#5a7b8b',
            'untouched_forest_1': '#006400',
            'untouched_forest_2': '#004d00',
            'untouched_forest_3': '#003300',
            'water_body': '#008080',
            'burnt_forest': '#B8860B'
        }

We developed trends for all the composites over these ROIs as well, but NDVI had the most interesting initial findings.

composites = ['RGB', 'NDVI', 'MNDWI', 'NDBI', 'EVI', 'SAVI', 'FERRIC_IRON', 'BAI', 'SI', 'NDGI']

See what I do to get an idea of the project structure:

root = '.'

data_folder = pipeline.make_new_dir(root, 'data')
raw_folder = pipeline.make_new_dir(root, 'data/raw')
clipped_folder = pipeline.make_new_dir(root, 'data/clipped')
stacked_folder = pipeline.make_new_dir(root, 'data/stacked')
derived_folder = pipeline.make_new_dir(root, 'data/derived')
rois_folder = pipeline.make_new_dir(root, 'output/rois')
rois_initial_analysis_dir = pipeline.make_new_dir(rois_folder, 'initial_analysis')
tests_folder = pipeline.make_new_dir(root, 'tests')
envi_folder = pipeline.make_new_dir(data_folder, 'envi')
